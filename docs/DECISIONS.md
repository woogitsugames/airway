# Decisions

Format: **D-xx — title** (date, who) · decision · rationale · status.

## D-01 — Stage 0 is research and visual direction only (2026-11-02, owner)
No game code until the owner picks a visual direction. Deliverables: RESEARCH.md, 3–4 style directions with mockups,
recommendation. **Status: in force.**

## D-02 — Studio brand ≠ game title (2026-11-02, owner)
"Airway Games" (airway.games) is the studio brand. The game gets its own distinctive title: "airway" search results
are dominated by medicine and "airways" evokes Mini Airways. Title candidates in `docs/RESEARCH.md`.
**Status: title open — owner decides.**

## D-03 — Core direction: design the airline network, planes fly themselves (2026-11-02, proposal)
Route-network design on a globe, not air traffic control. Addresses Mini Airways' main weakness (per-plane
micromanagement). Altitude layers/corridors are out of the core. **Status: recommended, to be confirmed with the
style decision.**

## D-04 — Mockup tooling: static HTML/SVG generated in Node, rendered by Playwright (2026-11-02, Claude)
Mockups are built by small Node scripts (d3-geo + world-atlas for real coastlines) into static HTML, then rendered to
PNG at 412×915 and 915×412. No framework, no game code. Rationale: deterministic, cheap, reviewable PNGs; the same
projection maths will be reused by the real renderer later. **Status: in force for stage 0.**

## D-05 — No minimal "diagram" look; the world must be rich and illustrated (2026-11-02, owner)
Owner feedback on the first "Mapa pilota" mockups: "too minimalist, which makes it resemble Mini Metro". All directions are now
rich, illustrated worlds (terrain, buildings/airports, clouds, light) with gameplay information drawn into that world. The chart
direction is kept only as a record (`docs/styles/chart.md`). **Status: in force.**

## D-06 — Four directions for the owner's choice (2026-11-02, Claude)
A Diorama (3D low-poly globe, three.js), B Poczta lotnicza (outlined illustration, family), C Atlas (engraving + watercolour),
D Mapa pilota (rejected, D-05). Dropped before mockups: split-flap mosaic (even more abstract) and screen-print overprint (too
close to AirWar's poster style). **Status: waiting for the owner's pick.**

## D-07 — Market reality: Tiny Airline exists (2026-11-02, research)
Tiny Airline (Steam, coming soon, PC) already has drawn routes, range limits, nightly upgrades and a crowded-airport fail state on
a flat map. Our differentiators are therefore the globe, the day/night terminator (demand waves, curfews), hub transfers with
minimum connection time, and a portrait mobile-first design — not range or upgrades per se. **Status: informs D-03.**

## D-08 — Passenger identity by shape; colours CVD-checked (2026-11-02, Claude)
Destination regions use six glyphs that are none of Mini Metro's shapes: chevron, bow-tie, crescent, keyhole, tail-fin, bracket.
Colour only reinforces; every direction's six destination colours keep min ΔE76 ≥ 15 under protan/deutan/tritan simulation.
**Status: in force.**

## D-09 — Fonts must cover Polish (2026-11-02, Claude)
Every face is checked for ą ć ę ł ń ó ś ź ż before use. B612 rejected for this reason. **Status: in force.**

## D-10 — Working title "Hubline" in mockups only (2026-11-02, Claude)
Cleanest of the checked candidates. Placeholder until the owner chooses (see RESEARCH §7). **Status: placeholder.**
