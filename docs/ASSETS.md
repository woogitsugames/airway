# Assets and licences

Stage 0 (mockups only). Every font is SIL Open Font License 1.1; the licence text sits next to the font file in
`mockups/fonts/OFL-<Family>.txt` (downloaded from github.com/google/fonts/ofl/<dir>/OFL.txt). Font binaries were fetched
from Google Fonts (static TTF per weight) on 2026-11-02 by `mockups/fetch-fonts.sh`.
